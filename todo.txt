bugs ...
  can't repeat ...
    after edit, changing margin, selecting function: 
      wrong highlight -- maybe only local
    ...functionTopMargin
    = err

  can't fix ...
    margin ignored if function just fits << vscode bad vis ranges
    gutter highlight skips blank lines

todo ...

options ...

low priority ...
  files need 3 clicks after show or clear all marks
  a.js: ws.onopen = () => {  
  delete file leaves folder
  multiple items in one line

unlikely ...
  bounce on some func clicks
  incremental parsing
  chg funcnodes to use indexes not lines
    solves multiple items in one line

testing ...
  settings changes
  error test files
  adding, deleting, moving, and copying funcs
