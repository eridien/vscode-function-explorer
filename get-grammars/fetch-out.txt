(node:21008) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///C:/Users/mark/apps/vscode-function-explorer/get-grammars/fetch-grammars.js is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to C:\Users\mark\apps\vscode-function-explorer\package.json.
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
